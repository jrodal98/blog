      <description>I came across a few guides on the internet when trying to deploy a rocket application to a vps but wasn&amp;rsquo;t pleased with the level of detail given. I had to consult two or three different guides before I was successful.
This post should hopefully be sufficient for anybody with no experience using nginx, letsencrypt, and systemd.

It gives you 256 MB of memory, 10 GB of disk space, and 500 GB monthly bandwidth, which is more than enough for my needs.</description>
