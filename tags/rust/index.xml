      <description>I came across a few guides on the internet when trying to deploy a rocket application to a vps but wasn&amp;rsquo;t pleased with the level of detail given. I had to consult two or three different guides before I was successful.

It gives you 256 MB of memory, 10 GB of disk space, and 500 GB monthly bandwidth, which is more than enough for my needs.</description>
